## ClassicCastbars
Lightweight addon that adds castbars to the target frame and nameplates in Classic World of Warcraft 1.13.x.  
Castbars have configurable size, positioning and more.

## Install (---IMPORTANT---)
- When installing from Github, you need to unzip & extract `ClassicCastbars-master/ClassicCastbars` and `ClassicCastbars-master/ClassicCastbars_Options` into your AddOns folder, as two seperate    folders. (They're essentially two different addons)
  **Do not put the root `ClassicCastbars-master` folder into your AddOns directory.**
- You can also download a packaged version from WoWInterface [here.](https://wowinterface.com/downloads/info24925-ClassicCastbars.html)
  This way you can install it just like any other addon.

## Configuration
Type `/castbar` or go to `Escape -> Interface -> AddOns -> ClassicCastbars` to open options panel.  
Feel free to request new options, however, I want this addon to remain as blizz-like as possible so I won't
add any major things like retexturing frames.

    When forking the addon you should save the folder outside your WoW AddOns directory and  
    instead have two symlinks inside the AddOns folder pointing to
    ```forkFolder/ClassicCastbars/``` and ```forkFolder/ClassicCastbars_Options/```.
