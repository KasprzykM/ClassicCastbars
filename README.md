  When forking the addon you should save the folder somewhere outside your WoW AddOns directory and  
  instead have two symlinks inside the AddOns folder pointing to
  `ClassicCastbars/ClassicCastbars/` and `ClassicCastbars/ClassicCastbars_Options/`.  
  You will also need to manually install the libs for ClassicCastbars_Options. See "Externals" in `.pkgmeta` file.
