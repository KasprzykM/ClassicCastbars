## ClassicCastbars
Adds castbars for Target Frame and Nameplates in Classic World of Warcraft 1.13.x.  
You may toggle which unitframes you want to see castbars for. See configuration below.  

## Install
- Install as any other addon, but make sure that the addon folder is **called just "ClassicCastbars", not "ClassicCastbars-master" or "ClassicCastbars-v1.0.0".**
- You can also download from WoWInterface instead of Github [here.](https://wowinterface.com/downloads/info24925-ClassicCastbars.html)

## Configuration
You may configure this addon using chat commands:
- `/castbar target enable` - Toggles castbar for Target Frame.
- `/castbar nameplate enable` - Toggles castbar for Nameplates.
- `/castbar target pos xValue yValue` - Set X and Y offset position for Target castbar.
  Negative X value will move bar left, positive right. Negative Y value will move bar down, and positive up.
  Replace xValue and yValue with your values, for example:
  `/castbar target pos 20 -40`
- `/castbar nameplate pos xValue yValue` - Same as above but for nameplate castbars.
